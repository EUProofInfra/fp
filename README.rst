How to get the files
--------------------

Run this from a workstation::

    git clone https://github.com/uob-fp/fp fp

You now have the latest files for Scrabble on your laptop in directory ``fp``.

From time to time, we may release new versions to fix problems. You can update to a newer version simply by running ``git pull`` inside ``fp``. We will notify you when newer versions are available.

----

You can also use Git from your laptop or home machine if you install it.

.. In case of problems
.. -------------------
.. 
.. Although we prepare the test bench with care, it is always possible that there is a bug. As usual, if you .. suspect there might be a problem, please report it on Facebook.

In case of difficulty
---------------------

We will do our best to help you in the labs. Outside the labs, Facebook_ is often a very good resource.
